## 2.Database Structure

To use this procedure, two tables are required in our database: Employees and Attendance. Below are the table structures:

sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    last_name VARCHAR2(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Attendance (
    attendance_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id NUMBER REFERENCES Employees(employee_id),
    attendance_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR2(10) CHECK (status IN ('Present', 'Absent'))
);

Employees Table: Stores employee information, including employee_id, first_name, and last_name.

Attendance Table: Stores attendance records with an employee_id (foreign key) and status indicating if the employee was 'Present' or 'Absent' on that date.
